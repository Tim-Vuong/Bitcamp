            Burchell&apos;s zebra (Equus burchellii): <br />
            Plains zebra range in height from 1-1.5 m (3.5-5 ft.) and can weigh
            almost 450 kg (1000 lbs.). Plains zebras have broad stripes that run
            horizontally towards the back and vertically towards the front,
            meeting in a triangle in the middle of their bodies. They prefer
            open grasslands, open woodlands, and open scrub environments. Plains
            zebras are herbivores and are known to travel great distances to
            find food and water when the dry season arrives.
